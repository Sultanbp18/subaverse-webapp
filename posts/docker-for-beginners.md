# Docker for Beginners

Docker is one of the most popular tools for containerization. It allows developers to package applications and their dependencies into a single, portable container.

## Why Docker?

- Consistency across environments  
- Faster development cycles  
- Lightweight compared to virtual machines  
- Huge ecosystem of prebuilt images  

## Key Concepts

### Images
An image is a snapshot of your application and its dependencies.  

### Containers
A container is a running instance of an image.  

### Dockerfile
A Dockerfile is a text file that contains instructions for building a Docker image.  

## Example: Building a Simple Docker Image

```dockerfile
# Use Node.js base image
FROM node:18-alpine

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Copy files
COPY package.json package-lock.json ./
RUN npm install

COPY . .

# Start the app
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Running Your Container
```bash
docker build -t my-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 my-app
```

## Next Steps
1. Learn about Docker Compose
2. Explore container orchestration with Kubernetes
3. Push your images to Docker Hub

By the end of this tutorial, youâ€™ll be able to containerize simple applications and run them anywhere.
