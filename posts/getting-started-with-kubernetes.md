# Getting Started with Kubernetes

Kubernetes has become the de facto standard for container orchestration in modern cloud infrastructure. In this post, we'll explore the fundamental concepts and get you started with running your first cluster.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes (K8s) is an open-source container orchestration platform that automates the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It was originally developed by Google and is now maintained by the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF).

## Key Concepts

### Pods
The smallest deployable unit in Kubernetes is a Pod. A Pod represents one or more containers that should be controlled as a single application.

### Services
Services define a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. They enable loose coupling between dependent Pods.

### Deployments
Deployments provide declarative updates for Pods and ReplicaSets. You describe a desired state, and the Deployment Controller changes the actual state to match.

## Getting Started

Here's a simple example of deploying a web application:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: web-app
spec:
  replicas: 3
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: web
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: web
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: web
        image: nginx:latest
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

## Best Practices

1. Always use resource limits
2. Implement health checks
3. Use namespaces for organization
4. Follow the principle of least privilege
5. Regularly update and patch

## Next Steps

To continue learning Kubernetes:
- Set up a local cluster using Minikube
- Learn about Helm for package management
- Explore monitoring solutions
- Study service mesh implementations
